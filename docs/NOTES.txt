+ AppRunner
Modified to use new FeedOrders functional interface and no longer refs AppXMLFeedsEnvironmentImpl

+ AppEnvironmentImpl
Made non abstract
feedOrders() method replaced with new FeedOrders functional interface, passed into constructor
Class no longer needs to be extended to be used

+ XMLOrderParser
Constructor takes OrderEventHandler (AppXMLFeedsEnvironmentImpl was too wide)
Creation of Orders moved to OrderFactory
startElement method simplified

+ OrderFactory
New class to create Orders, it definitely promotes 'open for extension' and use of higher order functions...

+ AppXMLFeedsEnvironmentImpl
Deleted, replaced with new FeedOrders functional interface as alternative to inheritance

+ Action
get method added to get by name

+ FeedOrders
New functional interface
Name not great

+ OrderBook
New interface
2 types, OrderBookByOrder & OrderBookBySymbol

+ OrderConsumer
pulled out method to consume orders into new functional interface (OrderEventHandler)

+ OrderType
New enum - tells us if bid/ask

Get rid of custom Log code, we dont need to write our own log, use existing API - java util logging for now.
Set log level via config, not code (we never want to change code just to change log level :))
